# Navigating Notes and Plans for Each Tech Talk
In each Tech Talk, I will prepare questions and review the Tech Talk material beforehand. I will take notes on important key concepts for each TT.

After completing the challenges associated with each TT, I will record my progress, struggles & key learnings in this Github Page (or on an alternative Jekyll site). TT challenge code will be executable through Repl.it.

### TT0:

Data Structures are: method of organizing data. Types of data structures --> primitive (intger, float, String, Boolean) & Non-primitive (Arrays, Lists)

Data Structures and Algorithms go together
* Data structures have the data & the algorithms access the data
* similar to how a for loop iterates through an array to access the data in an array

Imperative Paradigm & Object Oriented Paradigm
* Imperative paradigm -- uses statements to change a program's states
* Procedural Programming is a type of imeprative programming based on procedures
* Object Oriented programming -- classes and objects (what we've been doing in class) -- defining classes, extending classes, subclass-specific behavior & polymorphism

Structured programming has techniques to improve maintainability (diff from imperative paradigm)

### TT1:
Linked Lists:

Each object in a linked list have the data and a pointer to the next object.
* Linked lists are a way of managing a list of objects 

To access the data from an object, tmp illustrates this

##### Queues (First in First out)
keeping track of first in & first out
* need to keep track of current node for iteration

##### Stacks (Last in First Out)
* built using linked list objects keep track of last item inserted
